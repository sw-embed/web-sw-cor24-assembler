# COR24 CLI Tools

## Overview

The COR24 toolchain consists of three CLI tools and a web UI. All tools
are written in Rust and share the same assembler and emulator core.

```
Rust source (.rs)
    ↓ rustc --target msp430-none-elf --emit asm
MSP430 assembly (.msp430.s)
    ↓ msp430-to-cor24 (translator)
COR24 assembly (.cor24.s)
    ↓ assembler (built into cor24-run / Web UI)
Machine code (bytes in memory)
    ↓ emulator
Execution + final state
```

## cor24-run — Batch runner

Assembles a `.s` file and runs it in the emulator. No intermediate files
are produced — the assembler outputs bytes directly into emulator memory.

```bash
# Assemble and run, dump final state
cor24-run --run fibonacci.s --dump

# With instruction trace (last 50 instructions)
cor24-run --run fibonacci.s --dump --trace 50

# With UART input (for interactive programs like Echo)
cor24-run --run echo.s --uart-input 'abc!' --dump

# Timed execution with speed limit
cor24-run --run blink_led.s --speed 100000 --time 5

# Step mode: print each instruction as it executes
cor24-run --run fibonacci.s --step

# Run a demo with animated speed
cor24-run --demo --speed 100000 --time 10
```

### Options

## cor24-dbg — Interactive debugger

GDB-like command-line debugger with breakpoints, memory inspection,

## msp430-to-cor24 — Translator

Translates MSP430 assembly (from `rustc`) to COR24 assembly. This is
a source-to-source translator — `.msp430.s` text in, `.cor24.s` text out.
No binary files are involved.

### Direct translation (two files)

```bash
# Step 1: Translate MSP430 .s → COR24 .s (writes output to file)
msp430-to-cor24 demo.msp430.s -o demo.cor24.s --entry start

# Step 2: Assemble + run the COR24 .s file
cor24-run --run demo.cor24.s --dump
```

The translator reads the MSP430 `.s` file, writes a COR24 `.s` file.
The `--entry` flag specifies which function is the entry point (default:
`start`). The translator generates a reset vector that jumps to it.

Without `-o`, the COR24 assembly is printed to stdout.

### Compile mode (from Rust source)

```bash
# One command: compile Rust → MSP430 → COR24 (prints to stdout)
msp430-to-cor24 --compile ./my-project --entry start
```

This runs `rustc --target msp430-none-elf --emit asm` inside the
project directory, finds the generated `.s` file in `target/`, and
translates it to COR24 assembly.

### Full pipeline step by step

```bash
# Step 1: Rust → MSP430 assembly
cd rust-to-cor24/demos/demo_fibonacci
rustup run nightly cargo rustc \
    --target msp430-none-elf \
    -Z build-std=core --release \
    -- --emit asm

# The .s file lands in target/msp430-none-elf/release/deps/*.s
cp target/msp430-none-elf/release/deps/*.s demo_fibonacci.msp430.s

# Step 2: MSP430 → COR24 assembly (text file to text file)
msp430-to-cor24 demo_fibonacci.msp430.s -o demo_fibonacci.cor24.s

# Step 3: Assemble COR24 .s + run in emulator
cor24-run --run demo_fibonacci.cor24.s --dump --trace 50
```

### Intermediate files

All intermediate files are human-readable text:

```
src/lib.rs                    ← Rust source (you write this)
demo_fibonacci.msp430.s       ← MSP430 assembly (rustc produces this)
demo_fibonacci.cor24.s        ← COR24 assembly (translator produces this)
                              ← No binary file — cor24-run assembles in memory
```

### What the translator does

- Maps MSP430 registers (r4-r15) to COR24 registers (r0-r2) + stack spill slots
- Translates MSP430 instructions to COR24 equivalents
- Remaps MSP430 I/O addresses to COR24 memory-mapped I/O
- Passes through `@cor24:` asm comments as literal COR24 instructions
- Generates reset vector prologue (`mov fp,sp` + `la r0,start` + `jmp (r0)`)

### Pipeline demos

Pre-built demos in `rust-to-cor24/demos/`:

```bash
cd rust-to-cor24/demos
bash generate-all.sh        # Compile + translate + run all 13 demos
bash demo_fibonacci/run.sh  # Run one specific demo
```

Each demo directory contains all intermediate files after running:
```
demo_fibonacci/
    src/lib.rs                    ← Rust source
    demo_fibonacci.msp430.s       ← MSP430 assembly from rustc
    demo_fibonacci.cor24.s        ← COR24 assembly from translator
    demo_fibonacci.log            ← Emulator output (registers, memory)
```

## File Formats

| Extension | Format | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| `.s` | Text | COR24 assembly source (as24-compatible) |
| `.cor24.s` | Text | COR24 assembly from translator pipeline |
| `.msp430.s` | Text | MSP430 assembly from rustc |
| `.lgo` | Text | Luther's "load and go" monitor format |
| `.rs` | Text | Rust source |

There is no binary object file format. The assembler produces bytes
directly in memory — no linking step, no ELF headers, no relocations.
COR24 programs are flat: code starts at address 0, the reset vector
is the first few instructions.

## Assembly and Loading

The assembler is a two-pass assembler built into `cor24-run` and the
Web UI. It produces a byte array that is copied directly into the
emulator's 1 MB SRAM at address 0:

```rust
let result = assembler.assemble(source);  // → Vec<u8>
for (addr, byte) in result.bytes.iter().enumerate() {
    cpu.memory[addr] = *byte;             // load at address 0
}
cpu.pc = 0;                                // start executing
```

No separate linking or loading step. The assembler resolves all labels
internally using two passes (first pass collects label addresses,
second pass emits bytes with resolved references).
