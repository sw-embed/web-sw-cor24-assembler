//! Demo: Panic Handler
//! Demonstrates the panic handler output on UART.
//! Normal code runs first (writes 0xDE to LED), then triggers a panic
//! which prints "PANIC\n" to UART and halts.
//! Note: panic!() macro pulls in core::panicking which is too expensive
//! for our pipeline (no linker), so we trigger the handler directly.
//! Pipeline: this file -> rustc (msp430) -> .msp430.s -> msp430-to-cor24 -> .cor24.s -> assembler -> emulator
